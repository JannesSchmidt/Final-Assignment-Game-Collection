## TechBasics 1 Final Assignment

After trying very often to upload / push my code and having encountered at least 7 different kinds of error messages, I finally did it.
However, I do not like the transfer of the entire commit history.

I enjoyed the process. Especially since I was able to integrate previous code and improve it.

I highly recommend changing the DEBUG mode at least once, since I added extra music for that.
