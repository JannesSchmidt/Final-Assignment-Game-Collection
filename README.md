# README by Jannes Schmidt
## TechBasics 1

This is the repository of **Jannes Schmidt**, which has been created for the studies at Hamburg Media School.
Here **weekly Assignments** will be uploaded and changes will be understandably noted down in the commits.

_One will be able to observe the development of my programming skills and all the suffering that comes with it._

For example the attempt to remove the commits by moving everything to another repository.
_Spoiler... It did not work._ ðŸ¥²
